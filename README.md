# stationeers-mips

A series of MIPS "assembly" scripts written to perform various functions in the game "Stationeers".

To utilize these, check the alias definitions for devices (d0, d1, etc) to see what relevant devices are required.

Some scripts batch write/read devices from a connected network.

This is mostly a personal store for these scripts, but you are free to use them if you wish.
